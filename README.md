# Project Name: Rook Thaam

Project Description: 

Our project is a click-based game where we have to make sure each human can live for as long as possible till it dies due to a mosquito-borne disease.
Our OOP Game is based on creating public awareness for mosquito borne diseases and where such mosquitoes can stem from and how to prevent them from
breeding in the first place.


There are many breeding places such as trash,dirty and clean water,buckets,manholes for mosquito and that are placed randomly in the game.
There will be a lid to cover each breeding place so that mosquitoes can not breed. 
This works by basically dragging the specific lid of a breeding place and placing them on top of their breeding place.


Each human will move about at their own pace but if they're infected they will go to their own house and lie down. 
If they're clicked on while infected they will go to hospital where they will be diagnosed and the player will be asked to check their symptoms and
identify the disease. 
Humans can also collide with the breeding places if there is a lid on the breeding place which can cause the lid to be moved and can 
cause the mosquitoes to start breeding again. 


Our game will deal with both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Mosquitoes can enter inside house and can leave house through windows and door but they can't enter Hospital.


There will be a shopping cart in each house and there will be an allocated amount of money in each house. 
Through the shopping cart you can buy DDT to kill the mosquitoes in your house, repellant to prevent mosquitoes to come to you, nets to cover the windows
and badmedicine to damage the human as a person who is infected with a mosquito borne disease should not eat medicine as it will deteriorate their health.


The governing factors of this game is the budget of each house and 
how quickly the player covers all the breeding places and 
how quickly each infected human is brought back to health in hospital.



Game ends when one human dies.
